// Board need no validation, squares and userID are database generated

// const boardSchema = Schema({
//     userID: Number,
//     squares: [ subSquares ]
// })



// So board should validate the user
// Within the GameId this userId exists

// that they are not already playing in this game (already have a board)
// Within this GameId this USerID is associated with an included boardID

// validate that the game exists

// And then game validator should validate that the theme exists

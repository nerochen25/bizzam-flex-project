## Bizzam - Flex project

### Bizzam

BizZam is an online platform for playing user created bingo boards! 

[BizZam Live](Coming soon) 

### Background and Overview

In BizZam, boards can be anything users wants to play, such as office bizzingo, lecture bizzingo, or even scavenger hunt bizzingo! 

BizZam is primarily built with the MERN stack, a combination of following four technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.

### Functionality & MVP

- [ ] User authorization: sign up and log in.
- [ ] Generate a board according to the admin's choice of categories.
- [ ] Display all the boards for that player.
- [ ] Allow players to join with a pin.
- [ ] Display all the players who plays that particular board.
- [ ] Store the square's details in the board and populate it for other players.
- [ ] Declare the winner. 
- [ ] Production Readme.

##### Bonus Features

- [ ] Allow images as proof.
- [ ] Share location as proof.
